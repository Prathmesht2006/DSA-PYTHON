# Given two integers low and high, return the sum of all integers from low to high inclusive.


# Example 1

# Input: low = 1, high = 5

# Output: 15

# Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15


class Solution:
    def forLoop(self, low : int, high : int) -> int:
        total=0
        for i in range(low,high+1):
            total+=i

        return total
